        Donald and Melanie Trump.
    <br>
    <p><strong>US President Donald Trump has said he and First Lady Melania Trump have tested
         positive for coronavirus and are now self-isolating.</strong></p>
    <p>Mr Trump, aged 74 and therefore in a high-risk group, wrote on Twitter: "We will get through
         this together."</p>
    <p>The president has "mild symptoms" of coronavirus, White House officials say.</p>        
    <p>Mr Trump's announcement comes just over a month before the presidential elections on
         3 November, where he faces Democratic challenger Joe Biden.</p>
    <p> The development comes after Hope Hicks, one of Mr Trump's closest aides, tested positive.</p>
    <p> In a tweet, Mr Biden and his wife Jill wished the first couple a swift recovery 
        continue to pray for the health and safety of the president and his family," he said.</p>
    <p> It is not clear whether Mr Biden is also being tested, and whether he will continue his 
        campaign on Friday with a scheduled visit to Michigan. He stood approximately 10ft (3m) 
        away from Mr Trump during the debate.</p>
    <p>Debate moderator Chris Wallace said on Friday he was getting tested.</p>
    <p>A person is required to self-isolate after either showing coronavirus symptoms or a 
        positive test. Meanwhile, quarantine restricts the movements of those who have been in 
        contact with an infected person, but are not themselves positive or symptomatic.</p>
    <p> Mr Trump has mostly spurned mask-wearing and has often been pictured not socially
         distanced with aides or others during official engagements.</p>
    <p> The coronavirus has infected more than 7.2 million Americans, killing more than 200,000 
        of them.</p>
    <h3>What do we know about Mr Trump's health?</h3>
    <p> <strong>Mr Trump's physician, Dr Sean Conley, released a statement late on Thursday</strong>, 
        saying the president and the first lady were "both well at this time, and they plan to remain 
        at home within the White House during their convalescence".</p>
    <p>"Rest assured I expect the president to continue carrying out his duties without disruption
         while recovering, and I will keep you updated on any future developments," the statement 
         said.</p>
    <p>The physician provided no further details.</p>
        
    <p>However, White House officials and US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin later said Mr Trump 
        was experiencing mild Covid-19 symptoms.</p>

    <p>According to Mr Trump's most recent physical examination earlier this year, he weighed 
        244lbs (110.7kg). This is considered to be obese for his height of 6ft 3ins.</p>
    <p>But Dr Conley stated at the time that the president "remains healthy". Mr Trump will also
         have the best medical care available.</p>
    <p>America's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says a person must self-isolate 
        for 10 days after a positive test.</p>
